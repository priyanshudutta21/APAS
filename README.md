# APAS
This APAS is an online platform to manage and control different phases of Projects at the level of Undergraduate /Post Graduate Program. 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 
This Automatic Project Allocation System has been developed to eradicate the existing inconveniencein the conventional system. This system aims to automate the current project allocation system . This system maintains a database of all the projects that are given by the teachers .
There are three main roles in this system – a student, a Teacher and an Admin.
The user/student is expected to fillup the form.

1.2 Aim and Objective
The manual process of project allocation meet the requirement, in order to make the job more effective some development has to be involved. However, the problem of this system is in the speed of the process and the dissemination of information to users of the system. In the existing system, it will take a student to must wait for teacher to collect his/her project topic. Sometimes, it takes days or even weeks to get a topic
The specific objectives are:
1. To design the interfaces required to implement this system.
2. To create a database that will be used to store projects and allocations. 3. To implement the system using PHP as the programming language.
4. Design the algorithm in order to allocate the projects.

Hardware and Software Requirement:
Hardware: The system will run on any computer with the following specifications:
Processor: - Intel Pentium (1.2GHz or above).
RAM: - 2 GB or above.
Internal Storage: - 256 GB or above.
Software: The system will run on any computer on any browser installed in the system.


Software Development Platform:
Frontend

HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
Bootstrap is a free open-source CSS framework 

Backend

PHP (Hypertext Pre-processor) is known as a broadly useful prearranging language that can be utilized to foster dynamic and intelligent sites.
MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL – Structured Query Language. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for MYSQL however, is for a web database.
AJAX - It represents Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX simply utilizes a blend of a program worked in XML HTTP Request object (to demand information from a web server) and JavaScript and HTML DOM (to show or utilize the information)
